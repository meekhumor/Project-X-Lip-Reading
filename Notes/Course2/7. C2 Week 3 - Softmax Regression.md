### Multi-Class Classification:
- We use Logistic Regression for Binary classification, which gives us one of two possible outputs for given input parameters.This means that the output which is the dependent variable has two possible outcomes.
- Using Softmax Regression we compute predictions such that the outputs for the given inputs could belong to one of multple classes. This is called Multi-Class Classification.

### Softmax Regression:
- The basic idea of softmax regression is to classify inputs into one of C possible classes.
- The output layer consists of C units, where each unit corresponds to one of the classes.Each unit gives us the probability of the image belonging to that category. The probabilities should add up to 1. We use a special activation function called Softmax to calculate these probabilities.
- How Softmax Regression Works:
  - 1. Input to Output Layer:
       - Raw Scores (Z) Calculation:
         - Compute Z for the final layer:
         - `ùëç=ùëä‚ãÖactivation¬†of¬†previous¬†layer+ùëè`
         - Where W is the weight matrix and b is the bias vector.

  - 2. Apply Softmax Activation Function:
        - We calculate a temporary variable called `T` by taking the exponential of the values in the output layer.
        - Compute element-wise exponentiation: `T(i) = e^Z(i)`.
        - Then we apply normalization to all exponentiated values T in the output layer such that they add up to 1. This gives us the probabilities for each category.
        - The normalization means the probablity of each T(i) value in output layer which is :
           - `a(i) = e^Z(i)/Œ£(e^Z(j))` where j ranges from 1 to C.
           - Where a(i) is the probability for class i and the denominator is the sum of exponentiated scores for all classes.
