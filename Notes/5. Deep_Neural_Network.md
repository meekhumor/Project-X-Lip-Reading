## Deep Neural Networks

- A deep neural network is a type of machine learning model that is more complex than a simple logistic regression or a neural network with just one hidden layer.
- It consists of multiple hidden layers, which makes it a "deep" model.

### 1. Forward Propagation

- Forward propagation is the process of passing input data through the neural network to compute the output.

### 2. Matrix Dimension

- The dimensions of the weight matrix (W) for each layer depend on the number of units in the current layer and the previous layer.

```
For example,
The input layer has 2 features, and the hidden layers have 3, 5, 4, and 2 units respectively. The output layer has 1 unit.
```

_The weight matrix for the first hidden layer (Layer 1) will be 3x2, because it needs to transform a 2-dimensional input into a 3-dimensional output._
